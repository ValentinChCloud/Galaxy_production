#5107
We achieved the same effect with some fancy proxying. E.g:

	location / {
		uwsgi_pass	127.0.0.1:4002;
		include		uwsgi_params;
		# Uncomment this section to permit only allowing one user to access Galaxy during mainteance periods.
		#if ($remote_addr ~* aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd) {
		#	uwsgi_pass	127.0.0.1:4002;
		#}
	}

Whenever we need to activate "maintenance mode", we swap the first uwsgi_pass to something unrelated like :9999 which isn't a proper uwsgi server. This causes the default response for people visiting our galaxy to be the 5xx error page (which we customize quite heavily).

Then the remote_addr is set to my IP address and only I can access galaxy while everyone else gets a nice maintenance page where I document what changes are being made, why, when the maintenance window is expected to end, etc.
